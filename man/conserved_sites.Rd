\description{
Conserved sites (indexed at 1) for the gp120 DEMB11US006 sequence, which is
used as an example founder sequence throughout the package. These sites were
identified using the \code{identify_conserved_sites()} function with the full
HIV ENV filtered alignment from the LANL HIV database.
See \code{hiv_env_flt_2022} for more details and the link to the entire alignment.
