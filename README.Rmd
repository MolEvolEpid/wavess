The goal of wavess is to simulate within-host viral sequence evolution
optionally including recombination, a latent infected cell reservoir,
and three types of selection (conserved sites, comparison to a fit sequence,
and antibody-mediated immunity).
The package also provides functions to pre-process data for input into the 
simulator, as well as post-processing functions to analyze the simulation output.
The post-processing functions can also be used on real data.
The default settings for the simulator assume that the sequences being simulated
are HIV gp120. 

## Installation
